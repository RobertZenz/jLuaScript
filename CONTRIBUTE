Important notes about patches
-----------------------------

Automatic formatting is enabled on the project, including formatting of the code
and organizing the imports and members of the class. The used code formatter is
attached to the repository as XML export, you must import it in Eclipse.

Unfortunately, there is no per project setting for the sort order of the class
members, you have to set it globally in the preferences:

    Java -> Appearance -> Members Sort Order

The order is as follows:

 1. Static Fields
 2. Fields
 3. Static Initializers
 4. Constructors
 5. Initializers
 6. Static Methods
 7. Methods
 8. Types

The sort order for members in the same category is:

 1. Public
 2. Package
 3. Protected
 4. Private

If you are unable to set these settings, please disable the automatic sorting in
the project settings and sort them by hand according to these rules.
